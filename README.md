Many articles today are difficult to read, cluttered with ads, pop-ups, and distracting layouts that make focused reading exhausting. This browser extension helps by turning articles into text-only reading views using [Mozilla's Readability library](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) with custom CSS informed by accessibility and readability research. It follows four design choices based on [W3C WCAG 2.2 standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/): a sepia background to reduce eye strain, 1.5× line spacing for better readability, 50–75 character line length to reduce eye fatigue, and sans-serif fonts that work well on screens.

**Shortcut key:** `Alt+Shift+Y` or `Command+Shift+Y`

**Limitations**: it's designed for reading plain text articles. Because it hides images, tables, and formulas, some pages may lose important context or meaning.
